- Movie recommendations tailored to emotion (Happy, Sad, Fear, etc.)
- Machine Learning based logic (Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree)
- Achieved above 80% accuracy

## 📌 Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 How It Works
1. User gives mood input (PANAS)
2. Based on mood score, recommends movies
